A coin game by Forrest Spade.

This game is for 2 to 6 players.

There are a number of different coins.
Each player is dealt one coin each at the start of the game.
The remaining coins are put face-down in an ordered stack.

Each coin has a different effect.
The player who ends their turn with both the chest and key in play wins.
